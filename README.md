How do I approach designing software?
     When designing software , my main goal is to first understand the requirements of the project and its objectives. Having a clear understanding of what      the prroject needs from me helps in tackling each component and dividing it into slices which will identify the non-functional requirements. This          project has mainly taught me how to work with 3D Graphics using OpenGl . I also used Qt creator to implement my UI making it easy to compile and run        my application on multiple platforms.
 How do I approach developing programs?
     My design process and development strictly followed each steps provided in the modules, from rendering the 3d object, choosing the proper lighting,        angling the camera and paying attention to the texture. I developed my program by breaking down my larger objectives into smaller ones and writing the      code one at a time, while incorporating libraries and existing formulas into my code. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science will give me the proper skills and knowledge in web programming and development, and computer graphics and visualization to help me       jumpstart my career.
